%	LETTER CONTENT

I am writing to you today in regards to the open position for a student technical assistant posted on the OSU employment website. I am very interested in the position as it combines many of my personal interests with my technical experience and classes I've taken so far in my career at OSU. 

Besides taking the ENT 331 course, Pollinators in Peril, I have always been interested in bees and other hive or colony species. After taking the class I have a greater appreciation for their role in our environment and have been interested in finding ways to contribute to efforts helping to preserve them. I worked for the Cowen Lab, part of the Hatfield Marine Science Center, for more than three years as an undergraduate research assistant. In that role I was responsible for managing, processing, and analyzing hundreds of terabytes of image data. I worked with scientists and researchers directly to design both the front-end and back-end of software analytical tools. My degree is in computer science with a focus on bioinformatics, so this role is of particular interest to me. I'd like to be able to apply the skills I've developed to interesting and relevant projects such as this position. 

If possible I'd like to come in for an interview! I'm a full time student on the main Corvallis campus and am able to begin immediately. Please let me know if there is any additional information or relevant documentation I could provide to clarify any questions.
